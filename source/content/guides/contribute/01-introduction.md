Welcome! This guide is designed to get you started writing and contributing documentation for Pantheon.

Welcome! Thanks for your interest in helping make Pantheon's documentation great.

Pantheon's documentation covers more subjects than any one person can be fluent in. The Docs team depends on the expertise present throughout every department of Pantheon, and **external contributors,** to help us solve issues for our customers.

The process outlined here covers the ways you can help contribute to docs, from quickly reporting issues with existing docs to **authoring a detailed guide as a Subject Matter Expert (SME),** including the typical contribution process for reporting an issue with existing documentation and for making simple edits to the docs.


In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Create (Write? Author?) a new documentation page
- Spin up your local environment using Gatsby
- Report issues with existing docs
- Make edits to documentation
- Something about troubleshooting

## Before You Begin

Please consider our recommendations for Tone, Style, and Voice when writing documentation.

Here are some resources to help guide you writing documentation that aligns with Pantheonâ€™s voice and style.

* [Inclusive Language](/inclusive-language)
* [Glossary Terms](/glossary)
* [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)
