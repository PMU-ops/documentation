This is an example of a partial.

It's reusable content so that editors can maintain a single source of information that can be included in multiple docs.

Keep the following in mind when using a partial:

- Check for existing partials first. Don't recreate existing content. Check the [partials directory](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/tree/main/source/partials) in the GitHub repo.
- Leave the heading out. Let the referring doc decide how to introduce the content for the context.
- Use links to headings that will work in any doc. Use `[Frontmatter](/style-guide#frontmatter)` instead of `[Frontmatter](#frontmatter)`.
